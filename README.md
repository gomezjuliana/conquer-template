# Conquer

This is a theme that's already made and available for download [here](http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer). I recreated the template from scratch to practice semantic HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JS.

I wrote a technical blog about this project. [You can read it here](https://medium.com/@julianagmz/how-i-made-this-responsive-web-page-and-what-i-learned-doing-it-f0ea2fd00e88).
